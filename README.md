# my_personal_website
Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal website! This website was developed as a project for school. It consists of three main pages: the Homepage, About, and Portfolio page, and has a unique feature that allows a contact form to dynamically appear.

Pages
1. Homepage
The landing page of the website.
Contains an introductory section about myself and navigation to other parts of the website.
2. About
Contains detailed information about myself, my skills, experience, and education.
Designed to give visitors an insight into my academic and personal journey.
3. Portfolio
Showcases projects that I've worked on during my academic career.
In the future it will provide information and links to the project repositories or live demos.
Special Features
Dynamic Contact Form
A button is available on the website which, when clicked, makes a HTML element appear displaying the contact form.
